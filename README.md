# CocoPi3
The CocoPi3 project is based on work from many other projects and individuals.  The sum of all the peices became the Raspbian based CocoPi3 distribution for the RPi3 (or B+).  This repo only includes scripts and/or configuration files at the moment, but this will allow for some very easy updating for bugs or enhancements.

More information about the CocoPi3 project can be found here:
